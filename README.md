# Features in inland annual (LMC) and coastal perennial (SWB) genomes

work in progress...
These are scripts we used for SNPS, PAVs, and CNVs.

Mimulus_guttatus_nanopore_genome_v1.2 has GENESPACE analyses with SWB and LMC only. We used this to detect tandem duplicates between the two ecotypes. Other GENESPACE analyses where we included IM62 can be found in the mimulus_guttatus/ directory.
